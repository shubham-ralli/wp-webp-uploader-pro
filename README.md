# WP WebP Uploader Pro

## Description
WP WebP Uploader Pro is a WordPress plugin that automatically converts uploaded images (JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP) to **WebP format** before storing them in the media library. It also replaces image URLs on the frontend with WebP versions to improve website performance.

## Features
âœ… **Automatic WebP Conversion** â€“ Converts images during upload.  
âœ… **Supports Multiple Formats** â€“ Works with JPG, PNG, GIF, and BMP files.  
âœ… **Optimized WebP Compression** â€“ Uses smart compression with adjustable quality.  
âœ… **Frontend Image Replacement** â€“ Automatically serves WebP images if available.  
âœ… **GD Library Support** â€“ Uses PHPâ€™s built-in `GD` library for conversion.  
âœ… **Prevents Duplicate Conversion** â€“ Skips conversion if WebP version already exists.
